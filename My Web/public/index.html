<p><strong>Sri Lanka as an agricultural country</strong></p>
<p>Sri Lanka is a country civilized before 3000 years ago from that day onwards people live in this country involved in agriculture.. Main purpose of this involvement is to produce their day to day food needs. Sri Lanka has 65610[9] sq. Km of surface area from that 27400 sq. Km used as agricultural lands. 1129694 ha were used as cereal production lands. Many of them were used to rice production which is main consuming food of country. In Sri Lankan agriculture we can identify 6 major sectors. They were Food crops, Plantation crops, Ornamental crops, Livestock, Fisheries, Forestry.</p>
<p>The main food crop of Sri Lanka is rice following corn, fruits and vegetables. Tea, Rubber, Coconut, Sugarcane and Oil palm were the main plantation crops, which helps to bring lots foreign currency to country. Sri Lanka is very famous for tropical ornamental crop market. Most common livestock product in Sri Lanka is cow's milk following chicken meat , pork and beef. Sri Lanka is an island country which is surrounded by Indian ocean this will lead to develop mass fisheries production but still most of them used to local consuming. In Sri Lanka most of labor population work as farmers providing services for above mentioned sectors.</p>
<p>Still most areas of country remains as rural areas which is used for agriculture. But with the emerging of new technology many people were moving to cities for seeking better jobs. As a result countries urban areas grows rapidly and lack of labor in rural areas for work in agriculture industry. The most common answer for that lacking labor problem is introducing new machineries to agricultural industry. This result in rapid increasing of agricultural machines within last few decades.</p><br>
<p><strong>Agricultural Machineries in the country</strong></p>
<p>In food crops production main machinery used in Sri Lanka is tractor. Tractor combine with land preparation, seeding, transplanting and processing tools when farmers used in field. Hand tractor is another commonly used machinery in Sri Lankan food crop production. Hand tractor is an economical machinery compared to tractors. Those farmers who cannot afford a tractor used hand tractor. This machinery also flexible in small size fields.</p>
<p>Combine Harvester is used to harvests rice and corn. In plantations still used direct human labor rather than machineries. Large scale livestock farms like Ambewela dairy farm use machineries but most of the livestock farmers in the country still practice old human labor base system in their livestock production. Although there are few agricultural sectors use machineries they also uses small and flexible due to small size land lot, traditional farming methods and level of life of the farmers.</p>
